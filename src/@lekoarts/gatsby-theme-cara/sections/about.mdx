# The AT&T Technology Development Program understands the competitive landscape of talent acquisition among technology students. 

We’ve been improving our offerings for more than eighteen years, and we’ve developed a strong brand on campuses and across student organizations and educators. Through purposeful partnerships and cutting-edge recruiting tools, we attract and hire with a focus developing innovative, diverse, and highly-skilled new employees who will become AT&T’s future technical leaders. These new employees can work with us as interns over a ten to twelve week timeframe, co-ops who work twenty hours a week throughout the course of a year, and as true full time employees available year round.
